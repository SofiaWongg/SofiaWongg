            <p>I have always felt a strong push to utilize creative strategies in everything I do. Encouragement from my mother and brother, both SCAD graduates, has helped me in many ways. You could say, creativity has been a crucial part of my upbringing.
                
                In the past few years, my focus on potential career possibilities has shifted from medical to art. While taking theater, color guard, art appreciation, and advanced visual arts I have experimented and learned a great deal about various art mediums.
                
                In high school, I participated in a large variety of activities including clubs, sports, as well as classes geared towards different career pathways. I focused on aiding the community through healthcare, education, and volunteering with groups that benefit individuals with special needs.</p>
